# Closed loop demos
In this repository, a demo presenting the operation of closed loop framework based on Kubernetes operator pattern is presented. The basic assumption behind the framework is that closed loop follows an architecture of autonomous system where several functional components operate in concert to provide loop functionality. Thus, multiple components can participate in the loop and each of them can be implemented as a separate Kubernetes operator (i.e., custom resource and respective custom controller). The philosophy and assumptions behind the framework are presented in the reports referenced in user guides available as README documents contained in this repository. Those guides describe, respectively:

**[README1.md](./README1.md?ref_type=heads)**: Demo-1 - guide for the demo summarizing the work done in 2023. Two cases are described in this document. The first one presents a single reactive control loop operating in isolation (simple case). The second one presents hierarchical setup of two interworking control loops (reactive control loop and deliberative control loop where deliberative control loop monitors and adjusts the operating parameters of the reactive control loop). A distinctive feature of in Demo-1 is that the decision making logic of each components of the loop is entirely hardcoded in respective custom controllers even if the logic can be defined declaratively by the user. However, any change of the logic requires code changes and uilding new image of respective custom controller. This document also contains a detailed guide explaining how to install and run the whole environment and deploy closed loops. The latter is mandatory if one attempts to recreate any of the demos presented here on her/his own.

**[README2.md](./README2.md?ref_type=heads)** Demo-2 - guide for the demo summarizing the work done in 2024. In this version, the framework from Demo-1 has been extended by allowing to delegate the decision making logic of the loop to external applications (through sending queries and receiving responses/decisions). This enhances the possibilitiers to declaratively define decision taking logic of loop components without the need to recompile the code and build new images of operator containers. As mentioned before, mastering the installation of the environment and loop deployment process as outlined in README1.md is required to sucessfully recreate Demo-2.
