# Closed loop demos
In this repository, a demo presenting the operation of closed loop framework based on Kubernetes operator pattern is presented. The basic assumption behind the framework is that closed loop follows an architecture of autonomous system where several functional components operate in concert to provide loop functionality. The loop is accomplished by potentially multiple components each implemented as a separate Kubernetes operator (i.e., custom resource and respective custom controller). The philosophy and assumptions behind the framework are presented in the reports referenced in the remaining documents in this repository. Those documents describe, respectively:

**[README2.md](https://gitlab.com/adenisiewicz/closedloop/-/blob/cl_demo/README2.md?ref_type=heads)**: Demo-1 - version summarizing the work done in 2023. Two cases are described in this document. The first one presents a single reactive control loop operating in isolation (simple case). The second one presents hierarchical setup of two interworking control loops (reactive control loop and deliberative control loop where deliberative control loop monitors and adjusts the operating parameters on reactive control loop). This document contains also detailed instructions on how to install and run the whole environment which is mandatory if one attempts to recreate any of the presenred demos (Demo-1 and Demo-2 - see below) on her/his own.

**[README3.md](https://gitlab.com/adenisiewicz/closedloop/-/blob/cl_demo/README3.md?ref_type=heads)** Demo-2 - version summarizing the work done in 2024. In this version, the framework has been extended to allow the delegation of the decision making logic of the loop from the the controllers to external applications and provide more flexibility in defining the decision taking logic without the need to recompile the code and build new images of the operators. As mentioned before, mastering the installation process described in README2.md is required to sucessfully recreate the Demo-2 use case.
