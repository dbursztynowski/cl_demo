# Closed loop demos
In this repository, a demo presenting the operation of closed loop framework based on Kubernetes operator pattern is presented. The basic assumption behind the framework is that closed loop follows an architecture of autonomous system where several functional components operate in concert to provide loop functionality. Thus, multiple components can participate in the loop and each of them can be implemented as a separate Kubernetes operator (i.e., custom resource and respective custom controller). The philosophy and assumptions behind the framework are presented in the reports referenced in user guides available as README documents contained in this repository. Those guides describe, respectively:

**[README1.md](https://gitlab.com/adenisiewicz/closedloop/-/blob/cl_demo/README1.md?ref_type=heads)**: Demo-1 - guide for the demo summarizing the work done in 2023. Two cases are described in this document. The first one presents a single reactive control loop operating in isolation (simple case). The second one presents hierarchical setup of two interworking control loops (reactive control loop and deliberative control loop where deliberative control loop monitors and adjusts the operating parameters on reactive control loop). A distinctive feature of the lopp is that the decision making logic of loop components is entirely hardcoded in respective custom controllers. This document contains also detailed guide of how to install and run the whole environment which is mandatory if one attempts to recreate any of the presenred demos (Demo-1 and Demo-2 - see below) on her/his own.

**[README2.md](https://gitlab.com/adenisiewicz/closedloop/-/blob/cl_demo/README2.md?ref_type=heads)** Demo-2 - guide for the demo summarizing the work done in 2024. In this version, the framework has been extended to allow for delegating the decision making logic of the loop to external applications and provide more flexibility in defining the decision taking logic without the need to recompile the code and build new images of the operators. As mentioned before, mastering the installation process described in README2.md is required to sucessfully recreate the Demo-2 use case.
